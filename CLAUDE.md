# CLAUDE.md — Claude Remote

Steer active Claude Code Remote Control sessions from Even Realities G2 glasses
(576×288 BLE HUD + touchpad + mic), with a companion phone panel. `README.md`
has the architecture, controls, and project layout; this file is the operating
notes and sharp edges.

Ship model: the client is distributed as a prebuilt `.ehpk`; the bridge runs on
any host logged in to Claude Code. So no secret may ever be REQUIRED at build
time — the panel's Settings card (runtime settings in localStorage, layered
above the baked `VITE_*` values in `config.ts`) is the end-user config path.

## Rules

1. **The bridge adds no Anthropic code.** It reuses `claude-rc-api`'s
   `RemoteControlClient` (checked out at `../claude-rc-api`) and layers on only
   the active+connected filter, a bearer/CORS guard, and the `control_response`
   builders for the two blocking flavors. Session control, streaming, and OAuth
   (including rotated-token reload) live in `claude-rc-api` — don't reimplement
   or add credential logic here.
2. **Only-active, always.** Surface and steer only sessions that are `active`
   **and** `connected`. The bridge filters server-side and every control action
   re-checks; a `409` (`BridgeError.isInactive`) means "gone" → toast + back to
   the list. Never act on an inactive session.
3. **Lean on the firmware — don't fight it.** The HUD uses the SDK's *native*
   widgets (`glasses.ts`), modeled on the `nickustinov/demo-app-g2` reference
   app. Never `rebuildPageContainer` while a body is being scrolled — it resets
   the native scroll position. Steady-state changes are per-container
   `textContainerUpgrade`s (header / body / footer diffed independently); a full
   rebuild only when the layout kind or a native list's items change.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # app dev server → 0.0.0.0:5175
npm run bridge       # bridge → 0.0.0.0:8790 (config from .env.local)
npm run bridge:uv    # bridge through ../claude-rc-api's uv env (sibling checkout)
npm run pack         # build + prepack → claude-remote-<version>.ehpk
npx @evenrealities/evenhub-cli qr --url http://<host>:5175   # sideload QR
```

- **Bump `version` in both `package.json` and `app.json`** (kept identical) on
  every code/manifest change — `pack` stamps it into the artifact name.
- **`pack` packs `app.local.json`, not `app.json`.** Prepack folds `.env.local`'s
  bridge host (+ `VITE_NET_WHITELIST_EXTRA`) into the gitignored local manifest.
  A pack made WITH `.env.local` present bakes your token/keys in — personal
  builds only; distribute only packs made with `.env.local` set aside. (The
  tracked manifest whitelists `"*"`; whether phones honor the wildcard is
  unverified on hardware.)
- **The simulator runs headlessly.** `@evenrealities/sim-linux-x64` is a
  GTK/WebKit binary: run under `xvfb-run` (on NixOS, put its libs on
  `NIX_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` via nix-ld) with `--automation-port 9898`, then drive it
  over HTTP: `GET /api/screenshot/glasses` (the exact 576×288 framebuffer),
  `POST /api/input {"action":"up|down|click|double_click"}`, `GET /api/console`.
  Relaunch after every edit — Vite HMR does NOT reload the entry module. The sim
  caps text containers at 999 bytes. Real hardware is still needed for the mic
  and true native scroll.
- **No Even bridge (plain browser) = panel-only mode** — glasses/gesture/mic
  paths skip; the session list, stream, and steering still work via the panel.

## HUD gotchas

- **The firmware font has NO emoji and NO dingbats** (`✓ ✗ ⚠ ⚙ … › •` render as
  nothing). Every HUD glyph must come from the `HUD` set in `glasses.ts`
  (`● ○ ! ◆ ◇ ☉ » ▶ ■ ← ·`). Ground truth: `nickustinov/even-g2-notes`
  (`docs/display.md`). **`ui.ts` is exempt** — the panel is a real browser
  WebView; rich glyphs there are intended, and it formats events itself
  (independently of the HUD-only `events/format.ts`). Don't "fix" it.
- **Native text scroll is boundary-only.** A text container with
  `isEventCapture:1` is scrolled smoothly by the firmware; the app only sees
  `SCROLL_TOP`/`SCROLL_BOTTOM` at the ends. The session view exploits this: an
  auto-following **live** tail + frozen multi-screen **history** windows
  (`EventLog.tailWindow/windowBefore/windowFrom`). Do not reintroduce software
  page-flipping.
- **The firmware renders text TOP-aligned and never auto-scrolls**, so an
  overflowing live tail hides exactly the newest lines. The tail
  (`EventLog.tailRows`) is budgeted by estimated visual ROWS (`LIVE_BODY_ROWS` ×
  `HUD_CHARS_PER_ROW`, wrapping counted) so it always fits — a byte budget alone
  can't guarantee that. Every session opens on this tail (`● live` running /
  `○ latest` idle); scroll-up enters history.
- **Content caps are BYTES, not chars** (~1000 per rebuild, ~2000 per upgrade,
  999 in the simulator), and HUD glyphs are 2–3 bytes each — an oversize body is
  **silently dropped** (the screen just freezes). `glasses.ts` byte-clamps every
  body (`BODY_BYTE_CAP`) and checks the rebuild/upgrade return value; the log
  packs windows by bytes (`LIVE_BODY_BYTES` / `HISTORY_WINDOW_BYTES`). Never
  size a body by char count.
- **Exactly one `isEventCapture:1` container per page** (the scroll/tap target).
- **Gesture events are messy:** they arrive as `listEvent` OR `textEvent` OR
  `sysEvent` — coalesce all three. `CLICK_EVENT` is `0`, which protobuf drops,
  so a tap arrives as `eventType === undefined`. IMU frames are ignored.

## Blocking prompts

- **Two kinds, two screens, both native lists.** A blocking `control_request`
  is either a **tool-permission** (the `permission` screen: `[Allow, Deny]`,
  Allow=row 0; answered via `/permission` — the full tool input lives on the
  panel, the HUD shows a clip) or a **question** (the `question` screen: the
  options + a trailing `← Dismiss` row; answered via `/dialog`). On BOTH,
  double-tap **sets the prompt aside** (sends nothing — see below).
- **`AskUserQuestion` arrives as a `can_use_tool` permission** (confirmed live),
  NOT a `request_user_dialog`: its `input` carries the `questions`, and `/dialog`
  answers it on the PERMISSION path — `build_question_answer` sends an `allow`
  whose `updatedInput` echoes `questions` (the tool crashes without it) plus
  `answers`, a map keyed by **question TEXT** → chosen label (list for
  multi-select; empty map = graceful dismiss). Discriminator:
  `isQuestionRequest` in `events/format.ts`. The `{status, result}` shape
  (`build_dialog_answer`) is an UNCONFIRMED fallback for true
  `request_user_dialog` / `side_question` kinds — verify against a live sample
  before trusting it.
- **Prompts QUEUE; they never hijack.** Three guards against stale/replayed
  requests: the bridge fetches history `desc` (newest events) so the stream
  resume cursor is never ancient; `EventLog.append` seq-dedupe gates all UI
  side-effects; prompts live in a FIFO (`prompts[]` + `answeredIds`) and retire
  on a matching `control_response` in the stream (our own answers echo back),
  on the turn's `result`, or via the poll safety-net when the session leaves
  `requires_action`. **An assistant event after a `control_request` does NOT
  mean it was answered.** A prompt presents immediately only while passively
  watching the live tail; otherwise it defers (footer `! needs you`) and shows
  on return to the session view. A blocked session opens straight onto its
  prompt (`findPendingControl` + `workerStatus === 'requires_action'`).
- **Set-aside = a STICKY defer (`promptSnoozed`).** Double-tap calls
  `snoozePrompt()`: marks the prompt `promptDeferred + promptSnoozed` and drops
  to the live tail without answering. The snooze flag is the one difference
  from a normal defer — the auto-present guards in `go('session')` and
  `enterLive()` skip snoozed prompts, so returning to live won't reopen it. It
  reopens only deliberately: the Compose menu's leading `! Answer question` /
  `! Review permission` row, or reopening the session. It clears on
  `presentPrompt`/`armPrompt`/`clearPromptState`, and the prompt still retires
  normally while set aside. Because the Compose list varies with pending state,
  it is snapshotted into `composeItems` on entry so a mid-menu stream event
  can't desync the firmware row → action map.

## Config & secrets

- **Layering, runtime wins:** panel-saved settings (`claude-remote.settings` in
  localStorage) → `VITE_*` baked from `.env.local` → defaults. When debugging
  "why THAT bridge/token", check localStorage before the env. Never make a
  `VITE_` secret required at build time.
- **The bridge reads `.env.local` too** (`RC_BRIDGE_*` keys; `VITE_BRIDGE_TOKEN`
  doubles as the token; CLI flags and process env win). With no token configured
  it GENERATES a word passphrase (`RC_BRIDGE_TOKEN_WORDS` words from
  `wordlist.py`, default 6 ≈ 62 bits) and persists it to
  `~/.config/claude-remote/bridge-token`; `--open` is the only unauthenticated
  mode. A user-set token is used verbatim.
- **Deepgram key** lives in `.env.local` or the Settings card; voice
  auto-disables when blank.
- `server/pyproject.toml` depends on `claude-rc-api` by DIRECT GIT URL — needed
  for the `uvx --from git+…` install path; PyPI would reject it (see
  `server/README.md`).

## Repo

- **PUBLIC** — origin is `github.com/ThatCrispyToast/g2-claude-remote`.
  Everything committed is world-readable: never commit tokens, tailnet
  hostnames/IPs, or personal paths (`.env.local` / `app.local.json` / `*.ehpk` /
  `*.log` are gitignored for exactly that reason). Distribution packs must be
  made with `.env.local` set aside.
- The local-only `backup/pre-publish-history` branch holds the pre-squash
  history and must NEVER be pushed; the old private `rc-g2` GitHub repo stays
  private. No auto-push — commit + push manually when asked.
